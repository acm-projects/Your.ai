Possible values are:\n\"\nemail\n\" - Reminders are sent via email.\n\"\npopup\n\" - Reminders are sent via a UI popup.\nRequired when adding a reminder.\nwritable\nreminders.overrides[].\nminutes\ninteger\nNumber of minutes before the start of the event when the reminder should trigger. Valid values are between 0 and 40320 (4 weeks in minutes).\nRequired when adding a reminder.\nwritable\nreminders.\nuseDefault\nboolean\nWhether the default reminders of the calendar apply to the event.\nwritable\nsequence\ninteger\nSequence number as per iCalendar.\nwritable\nsource\nobject\nSource from which the event was created. For example, a web page, an email message or any document identifiable by an URL with HTTP or HTTPS scheme. Can only be seen or modified by the creator of the event.\nsource.\ntitle\nstring\nTitle of the source; for example a title of a web page or an email subject.\nwritable\nsource.\nurl\nstring\nURL of the source pointing to a resource. The URL scheme must be HTTP or HTTPS.\nwritable\nstart\nnested object\nThe (inclusive) start time of the event. For a recurring event, this is the start time of the first instance.\nstart.\ndate\ndate\nThe date, in the format \"yyyy-mm-dd\", if this is an all-day event.\nwritable\nstart.\ndateTime\ndatetime\nThe time, as a combined date-time value (formatted according to\nRFC3339\n). A time zone offset is required unless a time zone is explicitly specified in\ntimeZone\n.\nwritable\nstart.\ntimeZone\nstring\nThe time zone in which the time is specified. (Formatted as an IANA Time Zone Database name, e.g. \"Europe/Zurich\".) For recurring events this field is required and specifies the time zone in which the recurrence is expanded. For single events this field is optional and indicates a custom time zone for the event start/end.\nwritable\nstatus\nstring\nStatus of the event. Optional. Possible values are:\n\"\nconfirmed\n\" - The event is confirmed. This is the default status.\n\"\ntentative\n\" - The event is tentatively confirmed.\n\"\ncancelled\n\" - The event is cancelled (deleted). The\nlist\nmethod returns cancelled events only on incremental sync (when\nsyncToken\nor\nupdatedMin\nare specified) or if the\nshowDeleted\nflag is set to\ntrue\n. The\nget\nmethod always returns them.\nA cancelled status represents two different states depending on the event type:\nCancelled exceptions of an uncancelled recurring event indicate that this instance should no longer be presented to the user. Clients should store these events for the lifetime of the parent recurring event.\nCancelled exceptions are only guaranteed to have values for the\nid\n,\nrecurringEventId\nand\noriginalStartTime\nfields populated. The other fields might be empty.\nAll other cancelled events represent deleted events. Clients should remove their locally synced copies. Such cancelled events will eventually disappear, so do not rely on them being available indefinitely.\nDeleted events are only guaranteed to have the\nid\nfield populated.\nOn the organizer's calendar, cancelled events continue to expose event details (summary, location, etc.) so that they can be restored (undeleted). Similarly, the events to which the user was invited and that they manually removed continue to provide details. However, incremental sync requests with\nshowDeleted\nset to false will not return these details.\nIf an event changes its organizer (for example via the\nmove\noperation) and the original organizer is not on the attendee list, it will leave behind a cancelled event where only the\nid\nfield is guaranteed to be populated.\nwritable\nsummary\nstring\nTitle of the event.\nwritable\ntransparency\nstring\nWhether the event blocks time on the calendar. Optional. Possible values are:\n\"\nopaque\n\" - Default value. The event does block time on the calendar. This is equivalent to setting\nShow me as\nto\nBusy\nin the Calendar UI.\n\"\ntransparent\n\" - The event does not block time on the calendar. This is equivalent to setting\nShow me as\nto\nAvailable\nin the Calendar UI.\nwritable\nupdated\ndatetime\nLast modification time of the main event data (as a\nRFC3339\ntimestamp). Updating event reminders will not cause this to change. Read-only.\nvisibility\nstring\nVisibility of the event. Optional. Possible values are:\n\"\ndefault\n\" - Uses the default visibility for events on the calendar. This is the default value.\n\"\npublic\n\" - The event is public and event details are visible to all readers of the calendar.\n\"\nprivate\n\" - The event is private and only event attendees may view event details.\n\"\nconfidential\n\" - The event is private. This value is provided for compatibility reasons.\nwritable\nworkingLocationProperties\nnested object\nWorking location event data.\nwritable\nworkingLocationProperties.\ncustomLocation\nobject\nIf present, specifies that the user is working from a custom location.\nwritable\nworkingLocationProperties.customLocation.\nlabel\nstring\nAn optional extra label for additional information.\nwritable\nworkingLocationProperties.\nhomeOffice\nany value\nIf present, specifies that the user is working at home.\nwritable\nworkingLocationProperties.\nofficeLocation\nobject\nIf present, specifies that the user is working from an office.\nwritable\nworkingLocationProperties.officeLocation.\nbuildingId\nstring\nAn optional building identifier. This should reference a building ID in the organization's Resources database.\nwritable\nworkingLocationProperties.officeLocation.\ndeskId\nstring\nAn optional desk identifier.\nwritable\nworkingLocationProperties.officeLocation.\nfloorId\nstring\nAn optional floor identifier.\nwritable\nworkingLocationProperties.officeLocation.\nfloorSectionId\nstring\nAn optional floor section identifier.\nwritable\nworkingLocationProperties.officeLocation.\nlabel\nstring\nThe office name that's displayed in Calendar Web and Mobile clients. We recommend you reference a building name in the organization's Resources database.\nwritable\nworkingLocationProperties.\ntype\nstring\nType of the working location. Possible values are:\n\"\nhomeOffice\n\" - The user is working at home.\n\"\nofficeLocation\n\" - The user is working from an office.\n\"\ncustomLocation\n\" - The user is working from a custom location.\nAny details are specified in a sub-field of the specified name, but this field may be missing if empty. Any other fields are ignored.\nRequired when adding working location properties.\nwritable\nMethods\ndelete\nDeletes an event.\nget\nReturns an event based on its Google Calendar ID. To retrieve an event using its iCalendar ID, call the\nevents.list method using the\niCalUID\nparameter\n.\nimport\nImports an event. This operation is used to add a private copy of an existing event to a calendar. Only events with an\neventType\nof\ndefault\nmay be imported.\nDeprecated behavior:\nIf a non-\ndefault\nevent is imported, its type will be changed to\ndefault\nand any event-type-specific properties it may have will be dropped.\ninsert\nCreates an event.\ninstances\nReturns instances of the specified recurring event.\nlist\nReturns events on the specified calendar.\nmove\nMoves an event to another calendar, i.e. changes an event's organizer. Note that only\ndefault\nevents can be moved;\nbirthday\n,\nfocusTime\n,\nfromGmail\n,\noutOfOffice\nand\nworkingLocation\nevents cannot be moved.\npatch\nUpdates an event. This method supports patch semantics. Note that each patch request consumes three quota units; prefer using a\nget\nfollowed by an\nupdate\n. The field values you specify replace the existing values. Fields that you don't specify in the request remain unchanged. Array fields, if specified, overwrite the existing arrays; this discards any previous array elements.\nquickAdd\nCreates an event based on a simple text string.\nupdate\nUpdates an event. This method does not support patch semantics and always updates the entire event resource. To do a partial update, perform a\nget\nfollowed by an\nupdate\nusing etags to ensure atomicity.\nwatch\nWatch for changes to Events resources.\nSend feedback"

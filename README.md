<p align="center">
Managing schedules and finding time for yourself can be difficult as a university student. Thankfully, Your.ai has got your back! Led by an LLM powered AI assistant, this web app will be able to connect to your calendar where all you need to do is speak or text the AI assistant how you want to tune your schedule, personal action items, and deadlines. Additionally, the web app can provide task management and organization in-house to make managing your schedule that much easier. Need to find time for the gym? Gotta do a grocery run this week? Finals to prep for? Your.ai can search your calendar and task list then reply to you with the best time management solutions just as if you were talking to your own personal assistant!
</p>

## MVP âœ…
* User auth â†’ account / profile
  * Google OAuth integration, set scopes to access/modify Google Calendar
* Speak or text a natural language prompt regarding your calendar or task list (find the earliest time for x, how can I adjust for y, add z to my schedule)
  * Speech is processed into text and used as prompting for the LLM powered AI assistant, responds with atomic actions the server can take on the calendar using the Google Calendar API
  * AI assistant replies to the user with both voice and text
* Push notifications that can be set by the AI assistant to remind the user of upcoming events or tasks due
  * Push notifications from the browser and/or email notifications
* Create KanBan boards / to-do lists from given tasks, or prompt with some project description
* Week-at-a-glance
  * Summary of weekly schedule and possible time management suggestions
